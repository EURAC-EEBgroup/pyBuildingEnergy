pyBuildingEnergy aims to provide an assessment heating and cooling performance of the building using the European Standard
ISO52016. 
The actual calcaulation methods implemented are: 

- [x] the (sensible) energy need for heating and cooling, based on hourly or monthly calculations;

- [ ] the latent energy need for (de-)humidification, based on hourly or monthly calculations;

- [x] the internal temperature, based on hourly calculations;

- [x] the sensible heating and cooling load, based on hourly calculations;

- [ ] the moisture and latent heat load for (de-)humidification, based on hourly calculations;

- [ ] the design sensible heating or cooling load and design latent heat load using an hourly calculation interval;

- [ ] the conditions of the supply air to provide the necessary humidification and dehumidification.
